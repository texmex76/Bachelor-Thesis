\section{Introduction}
The study of solid-state objects is of great interest for us, especially since some phenomena occuring in solids have a lot of commercial potential. There are some difficulties, however. It can be very challenging to look into a solid. Certain phenomena might be happening very fast (e.g. on a nanosecond scale), the lattice spacing might be very small (e.g. only several angstroms apart) and in every naturally occuring solid there are structural defects and lattice vibrations. All these things can obfuscate the basic workings of certain phenomena. On top of all that, we can't change a naturally occuring solid which is probably the biggest inconvenience. A way to circumvent all these problems is to just make a crystal ourselves, a crystal in which certain phenomena are happening much slower (e.g. on a second scale), in which there's a bigger lattice spacing (e.g. on a micrometer scale) and that is free of defects. That crystal will be fully controllable by us and we can change its structure as we wish.

In this thesis, we'll ask ourselves the question how to make atoms self-organize to create an artificial solid. For that, we'll establish a theoretical model in which we arrange atoms in a lattice. We'll obtain two configurations with two Hamiltonians whose properties we'll discuss. Simulations in the language Julia with the framework QuantumOptics.jl will show us if we're able to observe the properties that we expect.

\section{Explanation of the model}

What we want to achieve is to arrange atoms in a lattice to simulate a solid. We need to somehow hold them in place. For that, we'll use laser light. Consider the setup depicted in Figure~\ref{counter-propagating}. There are two lasers, each with the same frequency. If we set their direction on the same axis, but counter propagating with contributions $\propto \exp(ikx)$ and $\propto \exp(-ikx)$, a cosine pattern or standing wave of the intensity will form. In between, we put our atoms. There's a special trick now. We set the frequency of the laser $\omega_\text{l}$ way below the excitation frequency of the atoms $\omega_\text{a}$ (this is commonly called "red-detuning"). That will induce dipoles in the atoms and the dipoles will interact with the light field. Because of the dipole-light field interaction, there's now a potential for the atoms which is what we needed. The atoms will now sort of "fall" into the lowest points of the potential to minimize their energy. The light field intensity has a cosine pattern, thus the same will be the case for the potential ($V \propto -I$). Now we have an array of equally spaced atoms, already what we could call an artificial solid. To enhance atom-light field interaction, we'll take our setup one step further and introduce a cavity, as depicted in Figure~\ref{put_in_cavity}. There are two mirrors. The one on the left is partially transmissive to let the laser light in. We set the distance between the two mirros to $d = n \lambda / 2$ so that the light field will be amplified inside the cavity.

Red-detuning the lasers will induce dipoles in the atoms which interact with the light field, creating a potential for the atoms. As the atoms always strive to minimize their energy, they will position themselves at the "valleys" of the potential. We'll take that approach even further and put the atoms in a cavity. That way atom-light field interaction will be enhanced.}

\noindent There are different ways to get a light field inside the cavity. Figure~\ref{longitudinal_pump} depicts what we've discussed so far. There we shoot a laser parallel to the cavity axis into the cavity (longitudinal pump). Even if there are no atoms inside, there's still a light field. That is not the case if we pump transverally, as described in \cite{domokos2002} and shown in Figure~\ref{transversal_pump}. For transversal pump, if there are no atoms inside the cavity, no light field will exist along the cavity axis. To create a light field, here we rely on the atoms scattering the photons into the cavity, i.e. the atoms effectively create their own trapping potential. Pumping transversally, a couple interesting phenomena emerge which do not happen for the longitudinal pump. We will discuss those properties later. Now to the derivation of the Hamiltonians for those two systems.

\section{Derivation of the Hamiltonians}
For those wishing to refresh their knowledge in quantum mechanics, the introductory chapters of Fox's quantum optics book will be of great help \cite{fox} (it's a great quantum optics book in general). In this section we'll derive the Hamiltonians being used for the simulation: One Hamiltonian for longitudinal pumping and one for transversal pumping. We'll start with the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian which describes the interaction of a two-level atom with a single mode of a cavity-field. We'll then modify the Hamiltonian according to our needs step by step. We'll tackle the crucial details and reference parts of the derivation which are not presented here.

\subsection{The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian}
The Jaynes-Cummings model describes the interaction of a two-level atom with a single mode of a cavity field. The first appearance of the model was in \cite{jaynes}. Since we're dealing with both an atom and a light field at the same time, we have a composite system, i.e.

\begin{align}
\psi_\text{total} = \psi_\text{light} \otimes \psi_\text{atom}.
\end{align}The fact that we have two levels motivates a two-dimensional basis for the atom:

\begin{align}
|\text{g}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}, && |\text{e}\rangle = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}where $|\text{g}\rangle$ is the ground state and $|\text{e}\rangle$ is the excited state. Both states respond to the operators

\begin{align}
\sigma^+ = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}, && \sigma^- = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix},
\end{align}where $\sigma^+$ is the raising operator and $\sigma^-$ is the lowering operator. They have the properties

\begin{align}
\sigma^+ |\text{g}\rangle = |\text{e}\rangle, && \sigma^- |\text{e}\rangle = |\text{g}\rangle.
\end{align}The wave function for the atoms depends on the position, while this is not the case for the light field. Instead we will use photon number states or Fock states. A photon number state $|n\rangle$ thus represents a monochromatic quantized field containing $n$ atoms. The ground state $|0\rangle$ corresponds to 0 photons. The creation and  annihilation operators $a^\dagger$ and $a$ correspond to creating and annihilating a photon. We'll restrict ourselves to one dimension and start with an atom (or a Bose-Einstein condensate) in an external potential:

\begin{align}
H_0 = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V_\text{ext}(x).
\end{align}Now we place that atom in a cavity and it will interact with the cavity mode, creating more terms in our Hamiltonian that we have to consider. First, there's the energy of the field:

\begin{align}
H_\text{field} = -\hbar \omega_\text{c} a^\dagger a,
\end{align}where $\omega_\text{c}$ is the resonance frequency of the cavity and $a^\dagger$ and $a$ are the creation and annihilation operators. Next, we'll add a term describing the atomic transitions:

\begin{align}
H_\text{transition} = -\hbar \omega_\text{a} \sigma_z,
\end{align}where $\omega_\text{a}$ is the resonance frequency of the atom and $\sigma_z$ is the Pauli $z$-matrix which is defined as $\sigma_z = 1/2(|\text{e}\rangle \langle \text{e}| + |\text{g} \rangle \langle \text{g}|)$ or

\begin{align}
\sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & -1/2\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align} The Hamiltonian $H_\text{transition}$ describes the atom being in the ground state or excited state, the transition energy is $\hbar \omega_\text{a}$. The atom-field interaction we describe with following term:

\begin{align}
H_\text{interaction} = \hbar g_0 \cos(kx) (\sigma^+ a + \sigma^- a^\dagger),
\end{align}where $g_0$ is the coupling strength. Finally, we'll add the term describing the pumping:

\begin{align}
H_\text{pump} = \hbar \eta (a e^{i\omega_\text{l}t} + a^\dagger e^{-i\omega_\text{l}t}),
\end{align}where $\eta$ is the pumping strength and $\omega_\text{l}$ is the laser frequency. We now have the full Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian which is the sum of all terms above:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
H_\text{JC} = \underbrace{p^2 / 2m}_\text{atom} + \underbrace{V_\text{ext}(x)}_\text{external potential} - \underbrace{\hbar \omega_\text{a} \sigma_z}_\text{atomic transitions} - \underbrace{\hbar \omega_\text{c} a^\dagger a}_\text{field} + \underbrace{\hbar \eta (a e^{i \omega_\text{l} t} + a^\dagger e^{-i \omega_\text{l} t})}_\text{pumping} + \\
+ \underbrace{\hbar g_0 \cos(kx) (\sigma^+ a + \sigma^- a^\dagger)}_\text{field-atom interaction}.
\end{split}
\end{align}A more detailed derivation of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (starting from Maxwell's equations and quantizing the cavity mode) can be found at \cite{collapseandrevival}. In order to get rid of the explicit time-dependence, we transform the Hamiltonian to a frame rotating with $\omega_\text{l}$. The Hamiltonian now reads:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
H_\text{JC} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V_\text{ext}(x) + \hbar \Delta_\text{a} \sigma_z - \hbar \Delta_\text{c} a^\dagger a + \hbar \eta (a + a^\dagger) + \\
+ \hbar g_0 \cos(kx) (\sigma^+ a + \sigma^- a^\dagger),
\end{split}
\end{align}where $\Delta_\text{a} = \omega_\text{l} - \omega_\text{a}$ and $\Delta_\text{c} = \omega_\text{l} - \omega_\text{c}$.

\subsection{Detuning}
The derivation for the Hamiltonians for the following sections is taken from \cite{donner}. Now we derive heuristically a modified Hamiltonian. Going to the Heisenberg picture, we get:

\begin{align}
\dot{a} = \frac{i}{\hbar} [H, a] = i \Delta_\text{c} a - i \eta -i g_0 \cos(kx) \sigma^-.
\label{a_dot}
\end{align}Obviously, the kinetic energy and potential term vanish under the commutator. For the other terms:

\begin{align}
a^\dagger a = N, \qquad [N, a] = -a, \\
(a + a^\dagger) a - a (a + a^\dagger) = aa + a^\dagger a - aa - aa^\dagger & = 1 \\
\text{because we know:} \quad aa^\dagger & = a^\dagger a + 1, \nonumber \\
[\sigma^+ a + \sigma^- a^\dagger, a] = \sigma^+ \underbrace{[a, a]}_{0} + \sigma^- \underbrace{[a^\dagger, a]}_{1} = \sigma^-.
\end{align}The creation and annihilation operators ($a^\dagger$ and $a$) and the raising and lowering operators ($\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$) live in different Hilbert spaces and thus don't influence each other. A good reference for the commutator relation is \cite{bertlmann}. The time-derivative for the raising operator reads:

\begin{align}
\dot{\sigma}^+ = \frac{i}{\hbar} [H, \sigma^+] = \underbrace{-i \Delta_\text{a} \sigma^+}_{(*)} + \underbrace{i g_0 \cos(kx) a^\dagger}_{(**)}.
\end{align}For ($\ast$), we'll look at the matrix representation of the operators:

\begin{align}
\sigma^+ = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma^- = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \quad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & -1/2\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}We calculate the commutator relation $[\sigma_z, \sigma^+]$ explicitly:

\begin{align}
[\sigma_z, \sigma^+] & = \begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & -1/2\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & -1/2\end{pmatrix} = \nonumber \\[5pt]
& = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1/2 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0 & -1/2 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \sigma^+.
\end{align}For ($\ast \ast$), we'll calculate $[\sigma^-, \sigma^+]$:

\begin{align}
[\sigma^-, \sigma^+] & = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \nonumber \\[5pt]
& = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix} = -2\sigma_z \approx 1.
\end{align}In our case, the pumping laser is far detuned from the atomic resonance frequency, i.e. $\omega_\text{l} \ll \omega_\text{a}$. The atom thus only stays in the ground state and we approximate $\sigma_z \approx -1/2$. Since we're not interested in fast dynamics, we set $\dot{\sigma}^+ = 0$. We get:

\begin{align}
\sigma^+ = \frac{g_0 }{\Delta_\text{a}} \cos(kx) a^\dagger, && \sigma^- = \frac{g_0 }{\Delta_\text{a}} \cos(kx) a.
\end{align}Putting the above relation in equation~\ref{a_dot}, we get:

\begin{align}
\dot{a} = -i \Delta_\text{c} a + \frac{i g_0}{\Delta_\text{a}}  \cos(kx) a - i \eta.
\end{align}We can thus make a guess of the effective Hamiltonian:

\begin{align}
H_\text{long} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V_\text{ext}(x) - \hbar \Delta_\text{c} a^\dagger a + \hbar \eta (a + a^\dagger) + \hbar U_0 \cos(kx)^2 a^\dagger a,
\end{align}where we set $U_0 \coloneqq g_0^2 / \Delta_\text{a}$. Note that because $H_\text{long} \propto \cos(kx)^2$, the Hamiltonian is $\lambda / 2$-periodic. Later in the simulation program, we want to make sure all quantities are expressed in terms of the recoil energy $E_r = \hbar \omega_r$, where $\omega_r = \hbar k^2 / 2m$ is the recoil frequency. Therefore we factor our $E_r$ to see what we have to type into the program:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
H_\text{long} = \hbar \omega_r \biggl( \frac{1}{\hbar^2 k^2} p^2 + \frac{1}{\hbar \omega_r} V_\text{ext}(x) - \frac{1}{\omega_r} \Delta_c a^\dagger a + \frac{1}{\omega_r} \eta (a + a^\dagger) + \\
 + \frac{1}{\hbar \omega_r} U_0 \cos(kx)^2 a^\dagger a \biggr).
\end{split}
\end{align}In the simulation program, we will set $\hbar = 1$ and multiply each quantity by the preceding factors.

\subsection{Transversal Pump}

Now we'll tackle the transversal pump. Here the cavity mode will only be populated by photons which were scattered off the atoms. The Hamiltonian now reads:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
H_\text{trans} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V_\text{ext}(x) - \hbar \Delta_\text{c} a^\dagger a  + \hbar \eta \cos(kx) \cos(kz) (a + a^\dagger) + \\
+ \hbar \frac{\Omega^2}{\Delta_\text{a}} \cos(kz)^2 + \hbar U_0 \cos(kx)^2 a^\dagger a,
\end{split}
\end{align}where $\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency. Here we only consider one dimension, so we set $z=0$:

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
H_\text{transv} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V_\text{ext}(x) - \hbar \Delta_c a^\dagger a + \hbar \eta \cos(kx) (a + a^\dagger) + \\
 + \hbar U_0 \cos(kx)^2 a^\dagger a.
\end{split}
\end{align}Note that because $H_\text{trans} \propto \cos(kx)$, the Hamiltonian is $\lambda$-periodic. The only difference now to the longitudinal pump Hamiltonian is the spatial dependence in the pump term.

\section{Properties of the system}

\noindent We'll now discuss some properties that the longitudinally and transversally pumped cavities have and later tackle some further details only concerning the transversally pumped cavity. There is a fundamental difference how atoms scatter light in the longitudinally pumped cavity and in the transversally pumped cavity. For the longitudinal pump, if a photon with momentum $\hbar k$ in $x$-direction bumps into an atom, it will recoil backward, having now a momentum $-\hbar k$. Conservation of momentum thus requires the atom to have now a momentum of $2\hbar k$. For the transversal pump, when a photon is incident perpendicularly to the cavity axis, the total momentum in the $x$-direction will be 0. If an atom scatters now the photon along the cavity axis, it will now have a momentum of $\hbar k$ and the photon $-\hbar k$. The total momentum along the $x$-direction will still be 0. We see that the fundamental difference between longitudinal and transversal pump is the momenta the atoms are able to acquire. In the longitudinal case, there will only be momenta of $2n\hbar k$, where $n \in \mathrm{N}$, whereas for the transversal pump there are momenta of $\hbar k$. To illustrate the discrete momenta, take a look at the wave function representing the atoms inside the cavity:

\begin{align}
\psi(x) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{l} c_l \exp(likx) = \frac{1}{N} \Big( c_0 + c_{\pm 1} \exp(ikx) + c_{\pm 2} \exp(2ikx) + \dots \Big) .
\end{align}The variable $N$ is a normalizing constant. As previously mentioned, an atom inside the cavity cannot have any arbitrary momentum, but only multiples of $\hbar k$ due to the way momentum is acquired. If we plot the wave function as a whole, we don't see the discreetness of the momenta. However, if we perform a Fourier transform, we can access the $c_l$'s. For longitudinal pump, we thus only expect momenta of 0, $2 \hbar k$, $4 \hbar k$, $\dots$ corresponding to $c_0$, $c_{\pm 2}$, $c_{\pm 4}$ and so on. For transversal pump we expect momenta of 0, $\hbar k$, $2 \hbar k$, $3 \hbar k$, $\dots$ corresponding to $c_0$, $c_{\pm 1}$, $c_{\pm 2}$, $c_{\pm 3}$ and so on. In Table~\ref{wave_table} there are the $c_l$'s with the components of the wave function.

\begin{table}[!htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
$c_l$    & wave number & momentum    \\
\hline \\
$c_0$    & 0           & 0           \\
$c_{\pm 1}$    & $k \rightarrow \exp(ikx)$         & $\hbar k$   \\
$c_{\pm 2}$    & $2k \rightarrow \exp(2ikx)$        & $2 \hbar k$ \\
$c_{\pm 3}$    & $3k \rightarrow \exp(3ikx)$        & $3 \hbar k$ \\
$\vdots$ &             &            
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coefficients of the wave function. If we plot the position probability density, longitudinal and transversal pump might look quite similar. We thus perform a Fourier transform so we can access the $c_l$'s and gain further insight into the physical system. For longitudinal pump, we only expect $c_0$, $c_{\pm 2}$, $c_{\pm 4}$, $\dots$ while for transversal pump we expect $c_0$, $c_{\pm 1}$, $c_{\pm 2}$, $c_{\pm 3}$ and so on.}

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:self-organization} shows two Figures from a paper that investigates a Bose-Einstein condensate in a transversally pumped cavity \cite{Nagy2008}. On the right, we see what we're already familiar with: The peak of the position probability density is located at the lowest point of the potential. That atoms localize at the potential "valleys" to minimize their energy. On the left, there's an illustration of the order parameter $\Theta$ versus the pump strength $\eta$. When $\Theta = 0$, the atoms are uniformly distributed in the cavity. When $\Theta = 1$, the atoms are in a lattice pattern. The interesting thing about transversal pump (which is also described in \cite{domokos2002}) is that the atoms are initially resisting being ordered and suddenly arrange themselves in a lattice pattern depending on the pump strength. Initially, $\Theta$ stays at 0. At a critical pump strength however, suddenly the order parameter jumps up. This is also a behavior which we expect to see in our simulations later.

\noindent Notice also that in Figure~\ref{lattice_potential}, the wave function density and the potential are $\lambda$-periodic, as the Hamiltonian for the transversally pumped cavity is also $\lambda$-periodic. As such, there are two ways in which the atoms arrange themselves inside the cavity, as depicted in Figure~\ref{lattice_structure}. In our simulations, we will observe a $\lambda / 2$ periodicity. That is because we'll be looking at the superposition of two symmetric states that are just shifted by $\lambda / 2$. Measuring the system experimentally, we would obtain only one state. That is also the case when investigating the system analytically, as in \cite{Nagy2008}. When we're doing simulations, however, it won't be possible for us to separate the two states. Figure~\ref{densities_super} shows what we expect to see in the simulation.
