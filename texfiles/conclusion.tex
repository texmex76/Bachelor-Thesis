\section{Conclusion}

We demonstrated self-ordering in a longitudinal and transversally pumped cavity. Starting from the Jaynes-Cummings model, we modified the Hamiltonian for large detuning in a high-finesse cavity. We implemented simulations in QuantumOptics.jl, a package written in Julia. Our results meet our prior expectations and match with existing literature.
